## TL; DR
A rideshare bulletin board for college campuses that lets users request or post upcoming rides. A communal, sustainable way of ridesharing for college students.


## THE IDEA ðŸ¤©
Ride sharing for college campuses (especially longer distance?).
- could test on smaller scale at individual universities
- maybe venmo integration?: https://github.com/venmo/venmo-ios-sdk
- something like waze rideshare?: https://www.waze.com/carpool
- something like zimride: https://zimride.com
- uber/lyft could inspire UI: try to make a list of all screens?
- colleges have ride sharing (i.e. USC), but this could be useful cross campus and across demographics
