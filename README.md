# Ridesio - a ridesharing platform
Ridesio is a rideshare bulletin board iOS app (written in Swift) for college campuses that lets users request or post upcoming rides. Ridesio provides a communal, sustainable way of ridesharing for college students.

Ridesio was the 2nd Place winner for CodePath's Virtual Demo Day 2020.

## Acknowledgments
- [Codepath](https://codepath.org): The authors met in breakout rooms during the CodePath iOS Fall 2020 course. This course was one of the most comprehensive and engaging learning experiences we have had! The class taught us so much about application development, UI/UX design, and entrepreneurship, and we highly recommend it to anyone regardless of their desire to pursue mobile engineering as a career.
- [Zimride](https://zimride.com): This web only platform was the inspiration for Ridesio; we intend to bring the Zimride experience to mobile devices.
- [Suraj Chetnani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/surajchetnani/): Suraj was our mentor for the v0 prototype of the app; his advice and guidance was crucial to the success of our app at the CodePath demo day.
