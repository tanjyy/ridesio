	- what would make you use this over uber or lyft?

# Discussion
1. let's use analytics in the app
2. let's ship all the way to the app store!
3. seems like the course portal expects us to use Parse. maybe we should ask course organizers
4. show the notes file on github (with date and what you did)
5. name of app?


## topics for later
1. third party apis to use
	- venmo
	- google maps


Should we target super small audience at first for exclusivity or make the app publicly available?
How to use Git effectively?
Ask about legality of app idea: if someone gets hurt or has a bad experience or damages the car, etc, who is liable?
Which backend should we use? We were considering using Firebase or AWS, but don't know if we are suppposed to use Parse (course materials seem to indicate that).



1. Student Behavior Tracker
   - **Description**: Allows teachers, students and parents to stay up to date with student behavior in real time. Teachers can acknowledge positive student behavior when it happens, students can receive instant positive reinforcement and parents can be more tuned in to how their child is doing at school.
   - **Category:** Social Networking
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for the instant logging of student behavior. Students use the app to purchase goods from the student store and other rewards. The camera is used to share images with parents.
   - **Story:** Creates a team between student, parent and teacher. Allows good behavior to not go unnoticed and for students to get rewards and positive reinforcement from teachers, parents and peers
   - **Market:** Any school district or individual classroom teacher of any grade could utilize this app. District wide licensing and custom features could be used for monetization. 
   - **Habit:** Teachers are using this constantly throughout the school day. Students are using the app daily to check their performance and cash in on rewards.
   - **Scope:** V1 would allow teachers to access a roster of students and input behavior logs. Could actually be tested by a real teacher with a class of students. V2 would incorporate a student facing version for students to see their performance. V3 would add a way for students to earn and obtain rewards for goals met. V4 would incorporate a parent facing version.
