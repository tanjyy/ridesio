# Discussion
1. use analytics in the app?
2. ship all the way to the app store?
3. name of app?

## topics for later
1. third party apis to use
	- venmo
	- google maps

## questions for Suraj
- Should we target super small audience at first for exclusivity or make the app publicly available?
- How to use Git effectively?
- Ask about legality of app idea: if someone gets hurt or has a bad experience or damages the car, etc, who is liable?
- Which backend should we use? We were considering using Firebase or AWS, but don't know if we are suppposed to use Parse (course materials seem to indicate that).

## questions for admins
- Seems like the course portal expects us to use Parse. Can we use other backends like AWS or Firebase?
